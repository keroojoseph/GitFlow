# GitFlow

## Concepts of GitFlow
**Master Branch:**
- This is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a production-ready state.

**Develop Branch:**
-T his is the main branch where the source code of HEAD always reflects a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release. It serves as an integration branch for features.

**Feature Branches:**
- Created from: develop
- Merged back into: develop
- Naming convention: anything except master, develop, release-*, or hotfix-*
- These are used to develop new features for the upcoming or a distant future release.

**Release Branches:**
- Created from: develop
- Merged back into: develop and master
- Naming convention: release-*
- Used to prepare a new production release. This allows for minor bug fixes and preparing meta-data for a release (version number, build dates, etc.).

**Hotfix Branches:**
- Created from: master
- Merged back into: develop and master
- Naming convention: hotfix-*
- These branches are critical for maintenance. They allow you to fix a bug in production without interrupting ongoing work.

**Support Branches:**
- Support branches are often used for maintenance and are long-lived. They can be branched off from any commit in the repository and are used for hotfixes and other maintenance tasks.

## GitFlow Workflow Steps
***
1- Initialize GitFlow:

```
git flow init
```
2- Create a Feature Branch:

```
git flow feature start <feature-name>
```
Work on your feature, then push changes and finish it:
```
git flow feature finish <feature-name>
```
3- Start a Release:
```
git flow release start <release-name>
```
Complete the release by merging it into master and develop:
```
git flow release finish <release-name>
```
4- Hotfix a Bug:
```
git flow hotfix start <hotfix-name>
```
Finish and merge the hotfix:
```
git flow hotfix finish <hotfix-name>
```
## Advantages of GitFlow
- Parallel Development: Enables parallel development by segregating feature, release, and hotfix branches.
- Collaboration: Facilitates team collaboration with clear roles for each branch.
- Release Management: Provides an efficient mechanism for managing releases and hotfixes.

## Best Practices
- Regular Merges: Regularly merge changes from develop into feature branches to avoid massive conflicts.
- Automated Testing: Use continuous integration to test branches regularly.
- Documentation: Document your branching and merging strategy for your team.
